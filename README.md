# hello-world
Get to know me!
I'm a career-changer who was interested in the idea of neural networks over 20 years ago.  Had to do some other things with my life, but I'm finally coming back to exploring my original idea.  Hopefully I can make a worthy contribution to the field.
I programmed in C++ briefly when I was a kid, but this will be my first foray into programming since high-school.  Certainly first time using Git, GitHub, and R.  Also I have to re-learn statistics.  Yay!
